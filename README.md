## I highly recommend you use https://voidproxies.com ~ Voidproxies have a dedicated bypass to allow ipv6 connections on chess.com so you can create mass amounts on high threads


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

```
Clone the repo
npm install
Put proxies inside proxies.txt (if you want to use, but I highly recommend you do)
node main
```
